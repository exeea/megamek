# Terrain updates, detail and render caches

Most rendering work is coordinated by `GpuTerrain`, but each cache has a different
owner and invalidation boundary. Use this guide when a view rebuilds too often,
stutters during edits, or draws stale geometry.

For the realism scope and the user's decisions, start with
[terrain realism](gpu-terrain-realism.md#scope-and-decisions).
Ordinary flat tops use six-triangle fans. The
[landscape review](gpu-terrain-realism.md#native-reviews) renders five shipped
landscapes in the main renderer's top and isometric views and times settled
terrain frames separately from loading and whole-game FPS.
Older dated reports below apply to their recorded revisions and fixtures.

## Preparation and replacement

`BoardSource` publishes immutable scene/frame data. `GpuTerrain` captures that
scene and `TerrainSettings` in a request, prepares CPU geometry on workers, and
collects/uploads the result on the GL thread. Generation checks reject superseded
requests. A worker must not read changing Swing state or allocate GL resources.

An edit plan identifies changed tiles plus their geometric dependents. Shared
corners, road/bridge spans, shore mouths and fields can reach beyond a single hex
or chunk. Reuse unchanged tile meshes where their inputs still match, and replace
the affected installed resources together. A new scene object alone is not a
reason to rebuild everything.

An edited hex rebuilds the hexes within its reach (`GpuTerrain.editReach`): two
rings for dry relief, features, ice, biome or ground cover; three for a level,
ground or road edit within six hexes of liquid, and for a pool that only grows
deeper or shallower while staying at least a level deep, since beyond a level the
shore field and river channels read no depth; `BoardSurface.SHORE_RINGS` (six)
where liquid appears or disappears or a neighbour's shore class changes. Changed
river currents and bridge spans add their own hexes. The on-demand
`GpuTerrainEditReachSmokeTest` applies and reverts edits incrementally on shipped
boards (`megamek.gpu.reach.boards`, `.samples`) and fails when a hex differs from
a full build or changed without being rebuilt. It leaves road masks' atlas slots
out of that comparison, since each build packs a section's masks afresh.

Camera refinement and local edits use the same bounded preparation pipeline, with
at most four sections in flight (`GpuTerrain.BUILD_JOBS`). A new board's update plan
starts on the first frame, and terrain program links wait until its first sections
have started, so those prepare on the terrain workers while the programs link.
Collection/upload is spread over frames, but the frame budget is soft: an individual
tile collection or buffer upload can overrun it. Retired chunks are disposed by
the GL owner once they are no longer installed or cached.

The opening screen retains the overall percentage of completed map sections and
lists the current task for each in-flight section in map order. Task percentages
and counts measure completed work (hexes, shapes, buffers or discrete operations),
not estimated time. The elapsed seconds belong to that task, including any wait
for its worker or the GL thread. Preparation, vegetation, roads, water fields,
models and mesh uploads have separate labels. Each job owns its progress and
publishes immutable snapshots; superseded jobs cannot overwrite a newer build's
status. Display updates occur between frames, so a single synchronous GL operation
can still pause the display until it returns.

## Coverage stencil flags near water (2026-10-08)

On `unofficial/VictorMorson/48x48.board`, looking at the lake with three dormant
geysers cut the frame rate on integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics. The geysers were
not the cost: removing their models or their spray changed nothing measurable. The
water was, and most of it was the biome/liquid coverage stencil
(`terrain-biome-mask.glsl`). The board's mud hexes switch the stencil on, and
`GpuBiomeSurface` also flagged every hex within two rings of any liquid, so the
lake's bed, its surface and its banks all ran the nine-hex stencil although the
lake holds a single palette.

A liquid hex now only records its palette on the hexes within two rings; a hex is
flagged when two or more palettes reach it, or, as before, when a biome hex lies
within two rings. For a single palette the stencil returns that palette or nothing,
and both callers already fall back to the water's own palette when it is skipped.

Iris Xe, 3840×2160, the 3D map preview's path (`GpuMapSource`), top view about five
hexes across, `glFinish` per frame. Old and new flags alternated in one process
through a scratch switch, two rounds, frame medians:

| View | Old flags | New flags | Stencil disabled |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Lake with geysers | 94.3, 98.0 ms | 74.4, 69.9 ms | 68.8, 72.1 ms |
| Grass beside the lake | 70.9, 73.6 ms | 65.4, 63.2 ms | 74.7, 62.3 ms |
| Mud hexes (stencil still needed) | 63.4, 58.5 ms | 62.8, 59.0 ms | 48.2, 43.1 ms |

In the lake view the new flags take about 14 ms from the opaque terrain pass (bed
and banks, 58–59 to 44–45 ms) and 9.5 ms from the water surface pass (21–22 to
12 ms).

Pixels: 17 deterministic captures (fixed animation step) of that board's lake, pond,
Mars pool and mud hexes, and of synthetic scenes with three palettes meeting, a
two-palette edge, marsh/field/mud contacts, marsh and quicksand beside water and a
lone pool far from mud and tundra, from above and isometric. Two runs of the same
code differ by one pixel per image at most, by 1/255, plus a z-fight seam at a
helipad that changes between runs. The new flags match the old within that, except
for up to four pixels per image differing by 1/255: on water, where the old path's
palette normalisation divides, and four on road kerbs in the mud view, away from any
changed flag.

Not adopted: dropping the two far hexes of the 3×3 stencil, which would keep a hex
and its six neighbours. With the shader's polygon distance a dropped hex lies 12.9 m
from a hex corner, inside the 14 m blend, so it carries up to 0.47% of the weight
over 3.7% of the area; the captures change by 1/255 on up to 0.03% of their pixels
near biome contacts. Alternated in one process over three rounds, the opaque pass
of the mud view measured 39.2, 42.9 and 49.4 ms with nine hexes against 40.4, 38.8
and 52.7 ms with seven: no measurable gain, so the exact stencil stays.

Per-quarter flags (2026-10-09): the texel's spare R bits 4–7 flag the quarters of a
hex's stencil cell (halves of its column and of its row) that a biome hex or two
palettes can reach, from the exact least shader distance between each nearby hex
and each quarter; fragments beyond the board edge keep the stencil. Checked against
the stencil itself on random boards (360,000 points), no skipped point would have
received a weight. Hex against quarter flags with the same shader, 20 captures
including Fenland's marsh and fields: 15 identical, 5 pixels in all at 1/255, one
of them the run-to-run pixel. Opaque pass, alternated over four rounds at 3840×2160:

| View | Hex flags | Quarter flags | Biome coverage off |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `64x68 Fenland`, marsh beside water | 81.2–88.5 ms | 75.7–77.6 ms | 43.4–46.1 ms |
| `64x68 Fenland`, fields meeting mud | 70.5–70.8 ms | 70.4–70.7 ms | 37.6–37.8 ms |
| 48×48, mud corner | 38.7–49.6 ms | 38.3–43.3 ms | 25.6–29.4 ms |

Quarters pay where few fragments lie inside a blend, such as a marsh's edge on open
water (frames 101–110 to 93–96 ms there); where biomes fill the view every quarter
is reached and nothing changes.

Limitations: one laptop (i7-13700H, Iris Xe, 4K panel); timings drift 10–25%
between and within runs, so only alternated comparisons are quoted, and the A/B
harness was scratch work outside the tree. Where biomes fill the view, their blend
and the shading it drives still cost 13–37 ms of the opaque pass at 4K on this GPU
(the coverage switched off for comparison), and the water surface pass about 12 ms
in the lake view.

## Level water-bed clipping (2026-10-07)

`BoardSurface` already builds sparse beds, but `GpuTerrain.prepareSculpt` used to
split them against every triangle of the water surface. Its internal diagonals
turned even a flat six-triangle floor into 293 triangles, without adding shape
or shading information.

A fully submerged bed under level water now keeps its original triangles and
receives that pool's water optics directly. Material transitions still use the
same sampler and adaptive subdivision. Depth-zero bars, descending streams,
waterfall lips and refined cliff contacts retain coverage clipping. Canonical
bed geometry, depth sampling, picking and the animated water surface are unchanged.

On Valencia, columns 65–96 and rows 17–48 contain 277 depth-positive water hexes.
Comparing the saved original sources with this change gives these **prepared
blended terrain** counts, including those water hexes' banks and material blends:

| Detail | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Full | 789,395 | 69,523 |
| Distant | 775,501 | 48,825 |

Both versions retain the same 21,075 canonical bed faces in that sample. Its four
flat-bed hexes go from 1,170 rendered triangles together to 24. These are regional
geometry counts, not a whole-board load-time or frame-rate measurement.
The focused mesh tests cover all four detail levels, varying depths, curved banks,
mouths and reconstructed water geometry. Local comparison sources, logs and
wireframe plots are in `build/water-bed-review`.

Verification: 84 CPU cases pass across bed geometry, coverage, material blending,
slopes, waterfalls and wet cliffs. A focused native render also passes, capturing
flat beds, changing depths and mixed shores in top and oblique views, with and
without water. The broader `GpuTerrainBlendSmokeTest` fails its dry-ground
edit/rebuild comparison before reaching the water captures; the saved original
code fails identically (mean byte error 0.0172764). That separate failure remains.

## Valencia loading investigation (2026-10-06)

`unofficial/VictorMorson/128x192 Texlos - Livius - Valencia_City.board` contains
24,576 hexes: 2,667 building, 3,329 road, 6,685 water and 128 bridge hexes,
with extensive jungle. The live-view loading test originally exceeded its
600-second terrain-settle limit. JFR attributed about 89% of sampled terrain
worker stacks to `BoardConcrete.distance`: it repeatedly reconstructed fitted
hex outlines and queried an immutable boxed-long map whose coordinate keys
collided heavily.

The fitted concrete outline now owns primitive-long maps and one derived
twelve-float polygon for each affected hex. Unmoved hexes return immediately.
Construction order and fitted corners remain unchanged; adjoining natural hexes
use the same derived outlines. These maps are constructed before publication
and never mutated by terrain workers. Water clipping also retains polygons
wholly inside or outside a clipping plane instead of allocating replacement
lists and temporary vectors; crossings keep the same interpolation.

| Run | Terrain build and visible-detail settlement |
| --- | ---: |
| Original | Exceeded 600 seconds; no completed load measurement |
| Concrete lookup/outline fix | 116.643 seconds |
| With clipping allocation reduction | 90.031 seconds |

All three runs used the same Valencia board, 1920×1080 full live view, RTX 4070
Laptop GPU, enabled terrain LOD, JFR profiling and no JaCoCo. They were sequential
workspace measurements with other source changes occurring between runs, not
a frozen single-variable A/B; do not derive an exact speedup ratio. The final
run spent another 9.429 seconds capturing board artwork/state and 1.182 seconds
opening the view before the measured terrain stage. It installed 384 distant
chunks and retained about 396 MiB of Java heap after GC.

The final prop pages occupy 501.706 MiB of vertex/index capacity for **each** CPU
and GPU copy, in addition to source caches. That figure includes ground scatter
as well as buildings, so it is not a building-only attribution or total memory
measurement. Terrain pages account for another 16.452 MiB per copy. Loading is
still expensive: remaining worker samples include shore-field/material queries
and water coverage clipping. Further work should measure those operations and
the contributors to duplicated prop buffers before changing quality, adding
workers, or introducing a disk cache. Current grass density and geometry detail
were not reduced for this result.

Seventy-nine CPU cases pass across concrete fitting, material blending, terrain
seams and water coverage, including distance-vs-geometry checks at three scales
and water clipping area/optics invariants. The final live Valencia view, underwater
cliff render and tree-LOD checks pass. Both existing 200×200 constrained-heap cases
also pass: full-resolution capture/editing and native rendering/picking/culling.
The native case sampled 511.5 MiB peak out of 512 MiB and retained 332.7 MiB after
GC. Its full render exercise took 432.56 seconds; passing this capacity check
does not establish satisfactory load time or frame rate at that heap limit.

## Valencia loading, second pass (2026-10-06)

The first pass above left the two terrain workers as the bottleneck. A JFR profile
of the working copy on a 20-core i7-13700H (one load, terrain worker threads only)
put 14% of worker time in the `ThreadLocal` lookup behind `TerrainSettings.current()`,
about 40% inclusive in `BoardSurfaceBlend.sample`, `sampleWater` and `sampleAt` (with
`contact`, `blendable` and `natural` as the leaves, and stream objects as a fifth of
all allocation), 15% in shoreline tracing through `BoardRiver.field`, 14% in water
clipping (`coveredPolygons`, `splitCovered`), 11% in `GpuRoads.mask` and 10% in
`GpuWaterShader.Field.prepare`. The pool was capped at `min(2, cores / 2)`.

### Changes

- **Workers.** `GpuTerrain.DEFAULT_WORKERS` is `max(1, min(8, cores / 2))`: 8 on a
  20-core machine, still 2 on a 4-core one. The bound of four chunks in flight is
  unchanged. `TerrainSettings.workers` creates numbered `TerrainSettings.Worker`
  threads that hold the active settings in a field; `current()` reads that field on a
  worker and keeps the thread-local scope for every other thread.
- **Material sampling.** `BoardSurfaceBlend.Sampler` serves one hex's vertices. The
  tiles that blend into a tile, its bank families and the pools around it never depend
  on the queried point, so they are derived once per tile, and a position asked again
  returns its earlier cover. The static `sample` and `sampleCliff` remain as one-off
  wrappers. `Tile.building()` replaces the per-call feature streams in `natural`,
  `blendable` and `BoardBiome`. `BoardGeometry.tile` reads the board dimensions once
  and uses `BoardScene.tile(int, int)`; `BoardScene.neighbor` avoids a `Coords` per
  neighbour lookup. `BoardConcrete.distance` chooses the nearest edge on squared
  offsets and calls `Math.hypot` once instead of six times.
- **Water clipping.** Each drawn water triangle's plane and edge normals are derived
  once per hex (`WaterTop`) and binned on a grid (`WaterCover`), so a face tests the
  few triangles near it, in the original application order. `splitCovered` takes its
  plane as floats, `GpuSurfaceBlend.degenerate` replaces the per-triangle `Vector3`
  cross products, and `appendPolygon` no longer streams.
- **River field.** Each `BoardRiver.Channel` keeps its bounds and the largest radius
  it can reach at any wander. A channel whose field cannot come within the union's
  rounding of the result so far is skipped: `smoothMin` is an exact minimum once two
  values differ by its rounding or more, so the skip changes nothing.
- **Harness.** `GpuTerrain.prepare` is static (the road-mask sharer is a parameter),
  so `GpuTerrainLoadBenchmarkTest` runs the real chunk preparation on a board region
  and checksums everything it produces. `gradlew :megamek:gpuTerrainLoadBenchmark`
  takes the `megamek.gpu.benchmark*` properties (board, region, LODs, workers,
  repeats, JFR file). Since batch 9 it loads the board as a game loads a sheet
  (`BoardFile.loadSheet`, converted: placed objects and car-park lane roads), so its
  checksums differ from the ones recorded below for the board as read.

### Measurements

Two detached worktrees at the same commit, differing only in these changes, were
measured alternately on an i7-13700H (20 logical cores, 32 GB, RTX 4070 Laptop GPU).
Every checksum matched at every detail level, including the whole board: the geometry
and materials are bit-identical. Other builds were running on the machine at the same
time, so the ratios are more reliable than the absolute times.

| CPU chunk preparation (warm repeats) | before, 2 workers | before, 8 workers | after, 8 workers |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 32×32 shoreline block, distant detail, 16 chunks | 5.35–5.46 s | 2.31–2.75 s | 1.39–1.60 s |
| 32×32 shoreline block, full detail | 4.81–4.97 s | 2.29–2.39 s | 1.29–1.42 s |
| whole board, distant detail, 384 chunks | not run | 48.6 s | 42.0 s |

Live load, `GpuBoardPerformanceSmokeTest.measuresTheCompleteBoardViewWithLiveCapture`
on the same two worktrees (1920×1080, terrain LOD on, 4 GB heap, JFR on, both runs
while other builds and a 13 GB smoke-test JVM from another session were running):

| Live Valencia load (terrain build and visible-detail settlement) | before | after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| detail-settle | 114.6 s | 68.5 s |
| frames during settlement | 13,984 | 3,012 |
| building-submission median / p95 | 4.0 / 15.4 ms | 13.9 / 49.9 ms |
| installed chunks | 384 distant | 384 distant |

The render thread now spends longer per frame on chunk collection and upload because
the workers hand it chunks faster; it is the next limit, not the workers alone (see
below).

The `boardview.gpu` unit tests fail the same 46 tests before and after at that commit;
none are introduced by this work. The earlier live run that ended in an
`OutOfMemoryError` had copied `gpuBoardSmoke.jvmArgs` into an ad-hoc task, which drops
the `-Xmx4096m` and leaves Gradle's 512 MB test-worker default; set `maxHeapSize`
explicitly in any such task.

### What is still expensive

A JFR profile of the whole-board preparation with these changes (eight workers, 6,848
worker samples) ranks the remaining worker time:

| Share of worker samples (inclusive) | Where |
| ---: | --- |
| 38% | water clipping in `coveredPolygons`: the clip itself (`splitCovered` 11% self), not the candidate search |
| 25% | `BoardSurface.<init>`, 17% of it shoreline tracing (`shoreline`, `firstDry`, `BoardRiver.field`); part of it rebuilds water hexes just outside the chunk at full detail, once per neighbouring chunk |
| 24% | `GpuRoads.mask`: `BoardRoad.pathSample` runs `Math.hypot` for every path segment of every mask pixel |
| 16% | `GpuWaterShader.Field.prepare`: `Pools.get` constructs the same out-of-chunk water surfaces, `Pools.sample` per texel |
| 5% | `BoardSurface.Face.height` scans every face of a surface per height query |

A piece-level skip in the clipping (leave a dry piece alone when its bounds clear the
water triangle's) was tried and removed: the half-plane tests of the original misclassify
points far beyond the apex of very acute water slivers, so the original keeps rounding
slivers that a bounds test drops, and the output changed (16 fewer triangles on the
reference block). An exact replacement would have to repeat the plane tests themselves.
A bounds-based skip of far path segments in `BoardRoad.pathSample` was exact (same whole-board
checksum) but not measurably faster in alternating runs (40.7 and 57.7 s with it, 39.5 and
49.8 s without), so it was dropped too.

On the render thread during the live load, Java samples put 39% in `collectTile` (decal
projection 12%, `ModelInstance.calculateBoundingBox` per prop 9%, foliage 6%), with the
prop pages (501 MiB of vertex data) copied and uploaded after the chunks are installed;
13% of its samples were regex matching with no MegaMek frame on the stack, which is
test-harness output handling, not the view. With chunks arriving faster, the render
thread's collect and upload slices (8 ms per frame while a board opens) are the next
limit on the live time; moving the per-prop bounds to a per-model cache and preparing
the non-sculpted blends on the workers are the obvious next steps there.

### Limitations

- One machine, under load from other builds; the live times are single runs.
- The shoreline block is the most water-heavy region of the board and shows the largest
  gain; chunks of pavement, buildings and roads gain less because their time is in
  concrete fitting, road masks and the water field texture, which are unchanged.
- The render thread's collect/upload stages and the capture phase before terrain
  construction are unchanged.
- Hexes where more than four cover families meet still subdivide to the depth limit
  (three such hexes on Valencia reach 27,000 to 114,000 blended triangles at distant
  detail in the working copy); that is pre-existing and was not changed here.

## Valencia loading and the editor, third pass (2026-10-06)

The second pass left water clipping as the largest worker cost and did nothing for the
board editor, where one hex edit on Valencia took 1.4 s to show. Every change here keeps
the chunk output bit-identical (same `gpuTerrainLoadBenchmark` checksums, f63fbf6e distant
and 56af45d8 full on the reference block) and, for the atlas, the same rendered pixels.

### Changes

- **Exact clip skip.** `WaterTop.misses` tests a dry piece's vertices against the same
  four clipping planes the clip uses. When every vertex lies beyond one plane by more than
  rounding (0.01 world units), the clip at that plane would keep nothing and hand the piece
  back whole, so the piece is left alone; `coveredPolygons` also keeps the piece list as it
  is until a triangle actually splits something. Unlike the bounds test tried in the second
  pass this repeats the clip's own half-plane tests, so acute slivers behave identically.
- **Opening slice.** A 32 ms render-thread slice while a board opens (instead of 8 ms) made
  no measurable difference (32.5 s against 34.5 s live, one run each), so the slice is
  unchanged. The limit there is the work per chunk, not the slice.
- **Editor: artwork per dirtied chunk.** `prepareUpdate` recomposes the rim, ground and
  decal artwork only for the hexes of chunks the edit dirtied and keeps the previous
  build's pixel objects for every other hex (`terrainPixels`, `normalPixels`,
  `decalPixels` fields). The change scan therefore also compares each hex's decal,
  tileset decal and tileset scenery artwork, which the atlas comparison used to notice
  for every hex. A changed limb model still recomposes everything.
- **Editor: concrete fit.** `BoardConcrete.adopt` lets a scene whose fit inputs did not
  change (ground, water, level, roads, cliff tops, structures and props) keep the previous
  fit, and `prepareUpdate` then skips the corner comparison. A planting edit no longer
  refits the whole board's concrete (layout 52 ms to 2 ms).
- **Editor: currents.** `BoardFlow.calculate` reads liquid hexes and their liquid
  neighbours only (`BoardLiquid.connects` needs both present), so a level or frozen change
  on dry ground no longer recomputes the board's currents; a liquid change still does.
- **Editor: atlas update.** `GpuTextures.updateRegions` compares each slot's artwork by
  reference with what the slot holds and looks only at the slots given other objects;
  equal artwork under another object is recognised by content and left alone. With the
  pages on display (`retainReplacedPages`), changed keys are rebound by `append`: artwork
  no live slot holds is packed into the existing pages and only those rectangles (with
  their duplicated border) are uploaded with `glTexSubImage2D`, then mip levels 1 and 2
  are regenerated. Slots keep a user count, so a slot nobody uses leaves the content index
  exactly when the full update would have dropped it, and the full update's compaction
  rule is evaluated on the same live area. A page that fills up still goes through
  `PixmapPacker.updateTextureAtlas`, which creates the new page's texture and reloads the
  pages packed into since. Before this, one new rim image on Valencia reloaded both
  2048×2048 pages (colour and normal, 100 ms on the Iris Xe) and rebuilt 49,152-entry
  maps three times (70 ms).
- **Editor: frame slice.** While an edit's rebuild is pending, `refine(camera, true)`
  gives collection and upload a 12 ms slice (was 6 ms; camera refinement keeps 2 ms), and
  `GpuTerrain.update(BoardScene)` drives its blocking loop with that slice too. A chunk's
  collection and upload take about 60 ms of render-thread time, so an edit now lands in a
  handful of frames.
- **Harness.** `GpuBoardPerformanceSmokeTest.updateWithTimeline` prints the wall time of
  every stage the terrain reports while driving an edit, the test adds a planting edit
  (woods on a plain hex) next to the level edit, and it captures `performance-edit.png`
  and `performance-woods.png` so an atlas or mesh change can be compared pixel for pixel.

### Measurements

Same i7-13700H; the invisible test window renders on the Intel Iris Xe, and another
MegaMek instance and other builds were running during most of these runs, so absolute
times vary by 2× between runs and only runs quoted together are comparable.

| CPU chunk preparation, reference block, 8 workers (warm repeat) | second pass | with the clip skip |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| distant detail | 1.39–1.60 s | 1.20 s |
| full detail | 1.29–1.42 s | 0.79–1.04 s |

Live Valencia load on a quiet machine, same test as the second pass: 32.5 s and 34.5 s (one run each with the 32 ms and the 8 ms opening slice), against 68.5 s under load with the second pass and 114.6 s before it.

One hex edit on Valencia (`measuresTerrainUpdatesAndSeparatedWater`, close view): the
level edit turns a hex into level-1 plain ground, which changes its rim artwork, its
concrete inputs and (before this pass) its currents; the planting edit adds woods to a
neighbouring hex and changes no ground, water or level.

| Edit on Valencia, wall time until the terrain is published | before the pass | slice and chunk-local artwork | plus atlas, currents, concrete |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| level edit | 1,419 ms | 452–465 ms | 321 ms |
| planting edit | not measured | 238–276 ms | 158 ms |

The old and the new atlas code were run back to back under the same load, each capturing the frame after both edits: `performance-edit.png` and `performance-woods.png` (1280×900) are byte-identical between the two, and the totals (486 against 511 ms, 212 against 342 ms, the later pair slower) are within that load's noise. Measured in-process on a quieter run, the atlas pass of the level edit takes 12.1 ms with the new code and the planting edit's 7.2 ms, against 171 ms for the level edit with the old code (two full-page reloads, 100 ms, and three passes over the 49,152 slots, 70 ms). The first build's atlas pass is unchanged at about 200 ms.

Per-stage timeline of the level edit after this pass (one run, loaded machine): queued 8, layout 32 (the concrete refit), changes 44 (including the artwork of the dirtied chunk and the atlas pass), sections 4, then for the one dirtied chunk surfaces 30, cliffs 16, topography 16, vegetation 32, water 58, models 17, meshes 47 and upload 13 ms.

### What is still expensive in an edit

- The dirtied chunk is rebuilt whole: surfaces, cliffs, topography, vegetation, water and
  models each run a parallel stream over its 64 hexes, and one chunk alone cannot keep
  eight workers busy, so these stages take 150–250 ms together for a full-detail chunk.
  Rebuilding only the edited hexes would need per-hex mesh ownership inside a chunk.
- A level or ground change refits the board's concrete (50–85 ms on Valencia) because the
  fit reads neighbours several hexes out (`continueSides`); bounding that radius exactly
  was not attempted.
- Collection and upload of the rebuilt chunk on the render thread (about 60 ms).
- The change scan over all 24,576 hexes (15–20 ms) and, for a liquid change, the
  board-wide currents (about 35 ms).

### Limitations

- All edit timings are single runs on a laptop shared with another MegaMek instance; the
  stage timeline is sampled from `buildDetails()` every 0.2 ms, so stages shorter than
  that merge into their neighbours.
- When one edit packs several new images, they are packed in the order the changed slots
  were given rather than in the previous code's hash-map order; placement inside the page
  was never a rendering property, but it is not byte-for-byte the previous layout.
- A page that fills still repacks the atlas, which moves every slot and rebuilds every
  chunk, as before this pass; on Valencia the 131 ground images use a fifth of each page.
- The live load time on this machine is now mostly chunk work and render-thread
  collection, not the atlas; the atlas change helps the editor only.

## Detail and support are different representations

`TerrainLod` chooses detail from projected size. Board dimensions do not determine
quality. Chunk refinement preserves shared boundaries so neighboring detail
levels meet. The bounded detail cache can retain a previous chunk representation
for a return to its scale.

`BoardSurface` and the finished tactical/support surface remain the basis for
picking, unit contact and vegetation placement. Rendering may simplify parts such
as a water bed within an error bound; it must not replace the canonical support
with an unrelated approximation. `TreeLod`, `MeshLod` and `FormationLod` select
their own tree, rigid-unit and formation representations.

The CPU geometry cache is bounded. Installed tiles keep weak links to their
finished support so a consumer already retaining that surface can reuse it after
cache eviction. Do not add a second strong cache for every tile to fix a repeated
lookup. Ground cover is planted by the same worker on that support and installed
with the tile; see [fields and marsh](gpu-fields-marsh.md#one-pipeline-for-ground-cover).

## Opaque drawing and pages

| Owner | What it combines or reuses |
| --- | --- |
| `GpuTerrainBatch` | Compatible terrain material state during opaque submission. |
| `GpuOpaqueSorter` | Ordering of opaque renderables to keep compatible work together. |
| `GpuPropBatch` | Static opaque prop ranges with compatible state. |
| `GpuTerrainPages`, `GpuMeshPage` | Small ranges from nearby chunks in persistent page buffers. |
| `GpuTreeInstances`, `GpuInstancedMesh` | Repeated models/transforms through instanced draws. Every chunk's trees stay uploaded per species and detail level in board order; a pass draws the visible chunks' ranges, so panning, zooming and detail changes upload nothing. Building parts still gather per pass. |
| `TerrainLod` | Ground sampling per level, chosen by projected hex size (64/24/6 px) with hysteresis. `BoardRelief` already emits six-triangle fans for ordinary planar hex tops at every LOD. Shaped cliff/coast boundaries retain their shared samples; concave outlines use polygon triangulation. Rounded cliff tops refine interior shading samples at the same playing height, so the six-triangle budget applies to ordinary tops without those rims. Dressing, slopes and walls have separate geometry costs. The earlier 573-face flat-ground measurement predates this implementation and is not a current cost or a pending optimization. Measure the installed scene before changing sample counts or thresholds. |
| `TreeLod` | Four plant levels by projected diameter (80/48/24 px, 10% hysteresis): the near mesh, two decimated meshes and, below 24 px, an impostor of 12 triangles: two crossed vertical cards and a cap through the crown, textured with unlit renders of the near mesh from the front, side and above (`mm-data/tools/prepare_tree_lods.py -- impostors`). The cards are ordinary alpha-tested geometry, so they shadow, write depth and pick like the meshes and read correctly from the top view, where only the cap shows. Far and middle views were primitive-bound (halving the window changed frame time little), so fewer triangles, not cheaper shading, is what pays there. A tree-only vertex shader without the scene shader's per-vertex light loops, shadow projection and fog was tried and measured identical (the driver already discards that unused work), so trees keep the shared vertex shader. |
| `GpuTerrainDepth` | Depth-only ranges borrowing finished chunk meshes and materials. |

Pages receive the source ranges from invisible chunks as well as visible ones.
Panning changes which existing ranges are selected, not the page's geometry.
Only replacement source ranges invalidate a page. One bounded page is built per
frame; original ranges draw while pending pages are prepared.

Building hover and unit cutaways retain the chunk's complete opaque source in
the static page. While a chunk is opened, its original ranges are hidden and its
existing cutaway cache is drawn separately. Moving the pointer between storeys
must not recopy the entire surrounding page. Colour, depth and shadow passes
still use their existing cutaway rules; `GpuBuildingHoverSmokeTest` checks both
the visible storey and the unchanged page-build count.

Page grouping is used for orthographic rendering. Perspective keeps the original
ranges and their projected-detail uniforms. Large meshes and ineligible material
states also remain separate. Do not merge transparent, cutout, instanced or
unusual depth-state work just because its texture matches.

### Dense urban hover measurement

On `unofficial/VictorMorson/48x48.board` (915 building hexes), opening a chunk
under the pointer previously replaced that chunk's page source and recopied its
whole four-by-four-chunk page. A controlled comparison on an RTX 4070 Laptop GPU,
1920 × 1080, used identical compiled classes and resources with only the old or
new `GpuTerrain` page policy substituted. Both runs used the complete live board
view, 80 warmup frames and 180 samples per view, `glFinish`, no JaCoCo, and GL
counting disabled during timing. The measured moving view was:

| Measure | Replace page source | Keep static page source |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Total render median / p95 | 6.521 / 16.341 ms | 8.193 / 12.893 ms |
| Frame interval p95 / p99 | 17.602 / 19.003 ms | 13.788 / 17.665 ms |
| Opaque submission p95 | 9.943 ms | 3.988 ms |
| Opaque GPU p95 | 10.808 ms | 1.005 ms |
| Cumulative prop-page builds | 32 | 4 |
| Opaque draws / submitted vertices | 415 / 627,432 | 436 / 627,432 |

This removes page-upload stalls, with a small draw-count cost for opened chunks;
it does not establish a general FPS increase. The median of the whole view was
slower in this pair. Native page comparisons retain identical pixels, including
pan/cull/edit transitions. The separate `GpuRoofHoverSmokeTest` checks legacy and
modular roof picks in both projections and confirms that roof hover leaves the
storeys opaque. The separate modular cutaway pixel assertion in `GpuBuildingHoverSmokeTest`
still fails on the same three pixels under both policies; its tolerance was
not changed. The roof-selection and prop-page pixel checks pass independently.
The measurements are recorded in `build/urban-review/frozen-old`
and `build/urban-review/frozen-patched` (2026-10-06).

Depth snapshots copy no vertex data. They must be recaptured when the owning
chunk's meshes, transforms or relevant material state change. Their borrowed
resources cannot outlive that chunk.

## Shadows, depth and animated fields

`GpuTerrain` can reuse a static terrain shadow when coverage, light direction and
terrain are unchanged. Moving units are drawn over the retained terrain shadow.
Both color and depth attachments must be restored: retaining only color leaves
incorrect depth for moving casters. Terrain changes, shader changes and unsuitable
shadow-camera coverage invalidate the cache.

`GpuAtmosphere` reuses the captured scene depth for fog, shafts and composition.
`GpuEffectDepth` supplies depth to effects that need it. These are distinct from
the light's shadow map. An animated cloud field changes direct illumination
without requiring a new geometry shadow.

Wind, water waves, cloud motion and most lighting changes update existing uniforms
or textures. Grass and plant buffers depend only on the installed plants of their
chunk; camera movement and time should not upload them again.

## Classic and Enhanced graphics

The 3D Graphics setting is a build mode of the same chunk pipeline ([GPU board](gpu-board.md#graphics-classic-and-enhanced)).
A Classic build prepares each hex's tileset column on the terrain workers (`GpuTerrain.prepareColumns`) and composes its
art in the update plan's texture pass; it builds no relief, sculpted material, water or lava field, wave simulation,
plant, road, biome map or ground cover, and its chunks have one level of detail, so the camera never refines them.
Enhanced builds no Classic data (no tileset decals, sprites or column art). A switch either way is a full rebuild
behind the loading stage; it gets the opening's 8 ms upload slice per frame instead of camera refinement's 2 ms.
The Tactical View hides fluff at draw time (`GpuTerrain.setFluffHidden`): the 3D prop caches and their pages stay,
and each chunk's few kept props are packed once on the view's first draw (`Chunk#keptProps`). Recaching every chunk's
props with the keep rule instead (the design's first plan) cost about 1 s more on entering the view on Valencia
(longest frame 1.9-2.3 s against 0.7-1.3 s before, RTX 4070) and rebuilt the prop pages both ways.

Measured 2026-10-12 on the user's laptop (RTX 4070 Laptop with `-Dmegamek.gpu.card=DISCRETE`, Intel Iris Xe with
`INTEGRATED`), 1920x1080 hidden window, `glFinish` per frame, 15 warm-up and 30 sample frames, before = 79273ff075,
after = this change, in `GpuBoardPerformanceSmokeTest.measuresTheCompleteBoardViewWithLiveCapture` with
`-Dmegamek.gpu.performanceGraphics` (one JVM loads one graphics, then switches to the other) and
`-Dmegamek.gpu.performanceTactical=true` (overview, close and moving in the 3D view, then in the Tactical View). Other
sessions' builds and, for long stretches, an interactive MegaMek client on the Iris Xe shared the machine: a scenario
during which a foreign Gradle test JVM ran, or other processes put 10 % or more 3D load on the card, is left out.
Ranges over 1-6 runs (NVIDIA) and 1-4 (Iris Xe). "Load" is the first frame to three frames without a terrain job;
memory is the used heap after `System.gc()` and the Windows GPU process memory (dedicated on the NVIDIA card, shared
on the Iris Xe) after load.

| Board | Loaded as | Load s, before / after (NVIDIA; Iris Xe) | Heap MiB | GPU MiB (NVIDIA; Iris Xe) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Valencia 128x192 | Classic | 64.1 / 28.4; 43.2 / 13.2 | 490 / 391-392 | 5512 / 1193; 6677 / 1278 |
| Valencia 128x192 | Enhanced | 53.9-78.3 / 63.7; 47.0 / 42.8 | 444 / 444 | 5616-5628 / 5556; 7214 / 6882 |
| MesaCity1 96x102 | Classic | 17.1-34.3 / 10.5; 16.7 / 5.0 | 231-232 / 211 | 1400-1402 / 440; 1926 / 402 |
| MesaCity1 96x102 | Enhanced | 23.0-29.9 / 20.8; 16.6 / 15.2 | 206-207 / 206-207 | 980-1669 / 1243; 2187 / 2144 |
| 48x48 lake | Classic | 19.5-19.9 / 7.7; 13.9 / 5.4 | 254-255 / 227 | 1247-1262 / 228; 1515 / 461 |
| 48x48 lake | Enhanced | 13.8-19.9 / 20.0; 21.4 / 15.8-20.3 | 251-252 / 251-252 | 981-1276 / 875; 1650 / 1354-1733 |

- Runtime switch on Valencia (settle / longest frame, NVIDIA; Iris Xe): Enhanced to Classic 4.5-7.9 / 4.2-7.3 s;
  4.1 / 3.6 s before (the 3D terrain stayed and the columns were built on the render thread) against 15.2 / 1.0 s;
  11.6 / 1.8 s after. Classic to Enhanced 3.8 / 3.2 s; 3.0 / 2.4 s before (the 3D terrain was already built) against
  85 / 3.6 s; 42.6 / 2.5 s after, a full build behind the loading stage. After a switch the other build's chunks are
  retired over the next frames: the Valencia heap after a switch to Classic reads 549-552 MiB in the first scenario
  and settles at 420-421 MiB by its Tactical View scenarios (a Classic load: 391-393), after a switch to Enhanced
  447-450 MiB (an Enhanced load: 444). A switch does not free `GpuAssets`: it keeps the Enhanced texture arrays (sculpt,
  road, magma) and the loaded models until the renderer closes, since the print and the editor previews borrow it.
  GPU memory after a switch was not sampled once settled (the last samples fall in the build or the shutdown).
- Entering the Tactical View on Valencia (settle / longest frame): NVIDIA Enhanced 0.9-1.6 / 0.7-1.3 s before,
  1.0-1.4 / 0.9-1.1 s after; Iris Xe Enhanced 1.3-1.4 / 0.7-0.9 s before, 1.4-1.6 / 0.9-1.5 s after; Iris Xe Classic
  0.9-1.4 / 0.7-1.2 s before, 0.5-0.7 / 0.4-0.5 s after.
- Frame time: the Tactical View's Valencia overview dropped in both graphics on both cards (median ms, before / after:
  NVIDIA Enhanced 24.8-42.0 / 15.8-24.7, Classic 20.4-41.0 / 16.8-18.3; Iris Xe Enhanced 71.4-72.3 / 42.3-47.1,
  Classic 45.8-46.3 / 23.5-24.9), as did the Iris Xe's 48x48 Classic Tactical View (overview 21.6-24.7 / 9.7-19.9).
  The other cells whose ranges do not overlap go both ways, by up to about 30 %, among them 3D cells whose drawing
  this change does not touch (Iris Xe Valencia Enhanced overview 81.0-81.1 / 82.1-105.0, close 17.6-19.2 / 20.0-22.1),
  and within a run the stages it does not touch (HUD, overlays, atmosphere) move by the same factor: that spread is the
  machine's state. Classic 3D close views read slower after (Valencia NVIDIA 7.6-12.0 / 12.3, Iris Xe 7.8-9.2 /
  10.6-11.6; MesaCity1 Iris Xe 6.5-8.0 / 8.8-9.0) with the same draws and vertices; in the Valencia Iris Xe pair the
  terrain's own GPU time rose 14 % against 23-24 % for the untouched stages, so no cost of the change is shown there.
  Entering the Tactical View packs each chunk's kept props once; later entries reuse them (the harness times the
  first).
- CPU preparation (`gpuTerrainLoadBenchmark`, Valencia region 64,16,32,32, 8 workers): the Enhanced chunk checksums
  are unchanged (DISTANT `f1c708af`, FULL `35b92066` before and after); a Classic build prepares the columns only,
  18-25 ms for the 1024 hexes with the column checksum unchanged (`d374c543`), where before it prepared the 3D chunks
  as Enhanced does (1.2-2.3 s per level) and built the columns on the render thread at the first Classic frame.

## Choosing the right place to investigate

If a stationary view rebuilds terrain, follow request equality, generation and
support-cache misses. If panning rebuilds page buffers, inspect source-range
identity and page membership. If geometry is correct but old flow, road masks or
biome appearance remain, inspect replacement material bindings and chunk-owned
textures. If an edit loses newer work, inspect the generation check at installation.

More triangles, more submissions, CPU preparation and GPU execution are separate
costs. A change to one does not establish a whole-frame improvement. Keep runtime
diagnostics in the existing rendering paths and keep measured claims scoped to
what was actually measured.

## Imported legacy scenery (2026-10-07)

Batch 9 (2026-10-10): every place that loads a legacy board converts it
(`BoardSceneryLayouts.convert`; docs/3d-board-editor.md, Legacy conversion), so no
legacy render exists any more and the "legacy" figures in this and the following
sections are history. The benchmark that measured them is now
`measuresValenciaInTheGameAndTheEditor` (see "Batch 9: one conversion, one capture" at
the end).

Opening a legacy board in the editor, or saving a game board as `.board2`,
imports its scenery tokens as placed objects (`BoardSceneryLayouts.importBoard`).
Outside the editor those objects were built as ordinary props: batched with the
other scenery, faded with their building, and plain trees in the instanced tree
stand. The editor kept every object an editable instance and drew its parts
instanced (see "Editor objects drawn instanced" below). Since batch 13 every view
draws them the editor's way ("Batch 13: one object renderer" at the end).

Valencia City (128x192), legacy `.board` against its import (4,484 objects in
479 groups; maglev and seaport stay legacy tokens). Measured by
`GpuLegacyImportSmokeTest.measuresValenciaLegacyAgainstImported`
(`gpuBoardBenchmark`), hidden 1600x1000 window, 60 frames after the terrain
settled, `glFinish` after each frame, two runs on the same laptop:

| | legacy | imported |
|---|---:|---:|
| `importBoard` | — | 573–609 ms |
| Board packet (`ObjectOutputStream`) | 4,030,278 bytes | 4,476,056 bytes (+11%) |
| XStream savegame XML of the board | 35,958,847 chars | 39,359,518 chars (+9%) |
| Map preview, whole-board overview, median frame | 12.8–14.0 ms | 12.6–13.1 ms |
| Map preview, close view of the densest hex, median frame | 4.5–5.3 ms | 3.0–3.5 ms |
| Editor, whole-board overview, median frame | 12.8–13.0 ms | 22.9–23.5 ms |
| Editor, close view, median frame | 4.8 ms | 5.9 ms |

The preview (the same chunk path as a game) shows no cost from the import in
these views. The editor rows are the state before the editor drew its objects
instanced; see below for the current numbers. The import
resolves artwork only for hexes with a FLUFF, `road_fluff` or `road:2` token. In
the opt-in `LegacySceneryCorpusTest`, whose test JVM runs with JaCoCo coverage,
Valencia's import took 7.9 s before that skip and 6.0 s after it, with identical
corpus totals (755 boards, 102,586 objects, 14,747 groups); the 0.57–0.61 s above
is the benchmark JVM without coverage, measured only with the skip. These are
local runs, not general guarantees; the close view is centred on hex 3509.

### Editor objects drawn instanced (2026-10-08)

The editor drew each part of each placed object as its own renderable: 5,136
imported Valencia objects gave about 9,000 opaque draws, and the frame was limited
by draw submission. Now `GpuTerrain.Chunk.cacheDecorations` splits the parts of the
placed objects: a part whose world transform is a place, a turn about z, one
horizontal and one vertical scale (`GpuTreeInstances.placeable`) and whose material
has an instanced shader goes to `GpuTreeInstances.add(Array<Renderable>)`, the path
the game uses for shared building modules, in the colour, depth and shadow passes;
tilted, mirrored and unevenly stretched parts still draw one by one. Plain placed
trees stand in the chunk's tree stand with its detail levels (`Chunk.restand`), as
in the game; a drag preview refills the stand with new arrays, and a part preview
only changes the gathered instance data. Nothing is packed, so an edit still
rebuilds only its chunk; the commit keeps the object meshes' instanced batches
(`retainParts`).

Same benchmark (now also printing a profiled frame's GL draws per render stage),
Valencia City imported (5,136 objects in 616 groups), editor; two runs per stage,
each started while no other build of this repository ran:

| Editor, imported | Median frame | p90 | Opaque draws | All draws |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Overview, before | 24.3, 24.2 ms | 32.1, 28.4 ms | 9,084 | 9,401 |
| Overview, parts instanced | 12.4, 14.4 ms | 15.0, 19.8 ms | 2,851 | 3,141 |
| Overview, and trees in the stand | 12.2, 12.4 ms | 15.0, 15.1 ms | 2,842 | 3,132 |
| Close view (3509), before | 5.2, 5.7 ms | 5.9, 6.5 ms | 963 | 1,129 |
| Close view, parts instanced | 3.8, 4.4 ms | 4.4, 5.6 ms | 165 | 304 |
| Close view, and trees in the stand | 3.4, 4.0 ms | 3.9, 4.8 ms | 163 | 302 |

In the same runs the imported map preview overview took 12.4–16.5 ms (2,758
opaque draws) and the legacy editor overview 11.1–13.5 ms (2,561). Instanced at
full detail, the placed trees already took one draw per species and part, so the
stand saves only 9 draws here; it adds the trees' detail levels. The benchmark fails when an editor
view needs more than the preview's opaque draws plus 150. These are local runs on a
shared laptop, not general guarantees.

### Cheaper drags and shared per-frame work (2026-10-08)

Three further stages of the editor plan, measured on imported Valencia City:

- **Drag previews read only what changed.** `GpuTerrain.previewEditorObjects` used
  to index every placed object on the board and visit every prop of every chunk
  for each new tile list, then scan every prop again for objects that crossed a
  chunk boundary. A chunk now remembers the tiles its props show (set when the
  chunk is built), the changed objects are found by comparing tile references
  (`changedPlacements`; the map source keeps unchanged tile objects), each chunk
  indexes its props by object id, and only chunks that show a preview are scanned
  for crossed objects. `GpuAtmosphere.configureClouds` likewise checks only the
  changed tiles for magma.
- **Animation skips idle chunks.** `GpuTerrain.animate` no longer builds maps and
  sets and scans every prop of every chunk each frame: a chunk without units in
  its bounds, without a hovered building interior and without faded props, and
  with an unchanged building opacity, has nothing to fade or restore.
- **Cover candidates only when cover can draw.** `renderCover` gathers the
  candidate hexes only when grass or crops/reeds can draw at the camera's scale
  (`GpuBiomeVegetation.visibleAtScale`, like `GpuGroundCover.visibleAtScale`).

A coarse level for generated industrial structures (half the facets, chamfered
bends, open small pipes, no coil or footing plates) was built and measured, then
removed: on Valencia it cut the 722 structures from 3.46M to 1.13M triangles
(overview: 252 to 127 draws, 10.4M to 3.4M indices), but in five alternating pairs
in one process the overview frame was 14.7 ms at full detail against 14.3 ms
coarse, and the opaque stage's GPU time 9.8 against 9.1 ms, within the run-to-run
spread. The opaque stage is limited by draw submission (about half of the render
thread's samples are `glBindVertexArray`), not by vertices.

Scratch harness (hidden 1600x1000 window, glFinish per frame, the benchmark's
views; the close view is hex 3509), runs alternating between the code before these
stages (including other work in progress at that time) and after them, started
only while no other build ran. The laptop was slower during these runs than for
the table above: the unchanged map preview overview measured 15.3–16.8 ms here.

| Imported Valencia, editor | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Drag a 23-object group, previews per tile-changing step (timed with `-Dperf.timePreview`) | 6.4, 8.0 ms | 1.6 ms (one run) |
| Drag, first frame after a tile-changing step (median) | 38.0, 34.6 ms | 20.7, 24.6 ms |
| Drag, release to settled | 507, 418 ms | 435, 409 ms |
| "Cutaways and light" stage, CPU median, overview | 1.00, 0.90 ms | 0.24, 0.20 ms |
| Overview frame median | 20.8, 18.9 ms | 16.2, 17.4 ms |
| Close view frame median | 6.0, 5.2 ms | 4.3, 4.5 ms |

The "cutaways and light" stage fell the same way in the legacy editor (1.46, 1.04
to 0.21, 0.28 ms) and the imported map preview (1.03, 1.05 to 0.22, 0.25 ms); their
frame medians stayed within the spread (legacy editor 24.4, 15.5 to 13.8, 21.2 ms;
imported preview 16.3, 16.8 to 16.1, 15.3 ms). The drag group is the one at hex
3509, moved in 60 pointer steps of 9 pixels, 28 of which changed the tiles. Only one
timed run measured the previews after these stages (1.6 ms); the other timed run of
that stage ran on an earlier build (4.3 ms) and the final runs did not time them, so
the final code's preview time is not measured. The first frames after a step stay
above 20 ms, and each step still redraws the changed chunks' geometry shadows
(3.7, 4.6 ms CPU and 4.2, 5.6 ms GPU median in the final runs): refreshing them only
on release, or every few steps, is the next candidate and has not been measured.

`gpuBoardBenchmark` `measuresValenciaLegacyAgainstImported` afterwards, two runs:

| View | Overview | Close view | Opaque draws (overview / close) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Imported, editor | 17.2, 17.8 ms | 4.5, 6.0 ms | 2,898 / 163 |
| Imported, map preview | 15.4, 22.9 ms | 5.0, 3.9 ms | 2,815 / 138 |
| Legacy, editor | 13.7, 17.3 ms | 3.7, 5.2 ms | 2,617 / 126 |
| Legacy, map preview | 20.2, 16.1 ms | 7.3, 5.8 ms | 2,619 / 126 |

On this slower day the imported editor overview did not stay below 13 ms; it ran
at the map preview's level. Still expensive: the opaque stage's 1,506 building page
draws over 23 meshes, split by 368 material values, and their vertex-array binds;
during a drag, each committed step rebuilds its chunk on the render thread, where
re-packing the chunk's road masks (`GpuTextures.update`) took about a tenth of the
samples. These are local runs on a shared laptop, not general guarantees.

### Valencia re-measure after the decal batch (2026-10-08)

After the decal batch (emblems and standard car parks imported as decals), every
placed decal was its own draw in every chunk it reached: imported Valencia drew 398
paint draws at the overview, and the imported editor's opaque draws rose from 2,898
to 3,098. Two changes in `GpuTerrain` bring them to 84:

- `Layer.paintGroups`: a chunk draws its paint in painter order, one draw per run of
  the same image. A decal joins the latest draw of its image unless a decal of another
  image drawn after that one shares a hex with it; one draw blends its triangles in
  index order. The draws are numbered (`GpuDecalOrder.layer`): 398 to 150 draws, 149
  being the sum of distinct images per chunk.
- `paintPages`: chunks never paint the same hex, so the same numbered draw of nearby
  chunks merges in `GpuTerrainPages` (isometric camera only, like the terrain pages):
  150 to 84 draws. A paint edit rebuilds only its page.

`GpuDecalBatchingSmokeTest` checks that a decal painted between two decals of another
image stays under the later one in the paged view. In `GpuDecalReviewSmokeTest` the 39
emblem decals add 16 draws to the overview instead of 45; the imported template board
draws 52 instead of 114 and the Perdition Spaceport crop 116 instead of 223.

`gpuBoardBenchmark` `measuresValenciaLegacyAgainstImported`, four runs before (machine
busy with other builds) and four after (`-Dmegamek.gpu.card=DISCRETE`, started only
while no other build or test ran). Frame medians and p90 per run, in ms; draws are
opaque / all:

| View | Before: median (p90) | After: median (p90) | Draws before | Draws after |

The legacy views did not change, so the machine was slower during the "before" runs.
A fair comparison is the scratch harness (same frames, `glFinish` per frame, 120
samples), alternating the code before, the code after and the legacy editor, three
rounds, imported editor overview median: before 13.7, 14.4, 13.5 and after 13.1,
12.3, 12.7 ms (with an extra change described below) in one session; before 17.5,
15.4, 16.2 and after 13.2, 14.8, 14.8 ms in a slower one, against the legacy editor's
10.8, 10.9, 12.1 and 11.6, 11.6, 12.7 ms.

Against the target (imported editor overview at most 13 ms, within 0.5 ms of the
legacy editor in the same runs): at most 13 ms in three of the four final runs;
within 0.5 ms in one (+0.2, +1.2, +1.3, +2.1 ms). Not met. (The legacy editor's draws
rose by one, 2,617 / 2,908 to 2,618 / 2,909.) Retired in batch 9: no legacy editor
exists to compare against. The benchmark then compared the game view and the editor
view of the same converted Valencia, which differed only by the draw strategy of placed
objects; since batch 13 they draw placed objects alike (see the end of this file).

What the remaining difference is, measured in the harness:

- Removing the editor's instanced object parts (189 instanced draws over 4,250 parts)
  takes the overview from 12.9–13.5 to 10.1–10.6 ms in the same process, and the
  opaque stage's GPU time from 8.8 to 6.9 ms. Without them the imported editor is
  faster than the legacy editor.
- Cutting every instanced part to one triangle (same draws, no geometry) leaves the
  frame where it was (11.7 and 11.4 against 12.6 and 11.5 ms; 9.4 and 9.5 ms without
  them): the cost is per draw, not the 1.7 million triangles.
- Gathering the instances each frame takes 0.14 ms, and no instance buffer is uploaded
  while the view is still. Reusing each instanced part's shader instead of looking it
  up every frame changed nothing measurable.
- Keeping the instance attributes in each mesh's vertex array between draws (libGDX
  enables, points and disables them at every bind) removed about 1,800 of 44,100 GL calls
  but did not change the frame time beyond the noise, so it was not kept.
- The imported map preview, which packs the same objects into prop pages, measured
  10.6–11.7 ms in the final runs: at or below the imported editor in each run, and
  between 1.8 ms below and 0.4 ms above the legacy editor of the same run. Most of the
  difference to the legacy views is drawing the imported objects at all: the legacy
  board shows them as flat tile art.

These are local runs on one shared laptop (RTX 4070 Laptop GPU), not general
guarantees. During this work a saved board preference (`BoardView3DGraphicsCard`)
switched later runs to the integrated GPU; the "after" runs and the harness rounds
above forced the NVIDIA card and were checked to use it, and the "before" runs
predate that preference.

### Small objects at a distance, one mesh per recolourable model (2026-10-09)

The two options the user approved for the remaining editor-overview gap (packing the
editor's objects into prop pages stays rejected):

- **Object LoD.** A decorative placed object (a `.board2` object or, from batch 9 to batch 13, a
  terrain-owned layout row such as rubble) whose world-box diagonal is under a quarter hex is small
  (`GpuTerrain.Prop.small`, set when its hex is built). Small objects are skipped
  while a hex is narrower than 12 framebuffer pixels: they hide below 10.8 px and
  return above 13.2 px (`TreeLod.SMALL_OBJECTS`, the tree levels' hysteresis), in
  orthographic views only. One decision per camera (`updateDetail`) and one
  predicate (`GpuTerrain.drawn`) serve every pass, picking and box selection.
  - Editor: each instanced or loose part keeps its object (`Chunk.decorationOwners`,
    `looseOwners`) and the gathers skip hidden objects: no re-cache, no per-edit
    work, and the commit still retains every part's instanced batch. Selected
    objects and those hovered in Layers or the side view are pinned by id
    (`GpuTerrain.keepShown`), so pinning re-caches nothing.
  - Game and map preview: each chunk packed its small props into caches of their
    own at the end of its prop pages, so hiding them rebuilt no page. Batch 13
    removed those caches once placed objects left the pages ("Small packed caches
    removed", below).
  - Shadows: the shadow pass applies the rule whenever it redraws; a crossing alone
    does not redraw it, as for tree levels and scatter. A forced redraw would drop
    the cached board-wide shadow map on every zoom-out to the overview, which the
    `renderShadows` comments record at 220–530 ms on the Iris Xe. Hidden objects are
    at most about 3 px, and so are the shadows that wait for the next redraw.
- **One GPU mesh per recolourable model.** The editor drew a mesh copy per colour set
  (`GpuAssets.model(name, colours)`), so 18 car colours were 18 instanced draws per
  pass. It now draws one shared mesh per slotted model (`GpuAssets.slotted`,
  `RigidGlb.colourSlotMesh`, with each vertex's shade relative to its slot's default
  and its slot); each placement passes its four slot colours in a third instance
  attribute (`a_instance2`; a uniform for parts drawn one by one and the side view),
  and the vertex shader applies `RigidGlb.recolour`'s rule
  (`model-colour-slots.glsl`). The 2026-10-12 color-pipeline update keeps model
  colors and shade ratios linear, decoding only the replacement sRGB color.
  The game and the map preview kept their
  CPU copies until batch 13: their packed pages already merged the copies into the same
  draws.

Checked by native tests (not timed):

- `GpuSmallObjectSmokeTest`: at a 9 px hex exactly the fixture's cars disappear from
  the colour and shadow passes, in the editor and the game; at 16 px nothing does;
  crossings rebuild no prop page; at 16 px the rule adds no draw, and at 9 px the
  game draws as many times as the same board without the cars. The editor's upright
  cars of two different colours cost one instanced draw.
- `GpuSceneryColourSmokeTest`: the editor's opaque pass draws the colour fixture
  109 times both with every object in its model's own colours and with the fixture's
  colours; the editor's close-ups of its 66 hexes, a mirrored car and a car in a
  colour far from the model's included, match the game view's CPU-recoloured copies
  (0 pixels over 2/255, 2 on one hex).

Valencia's frame times and draws with these changes are measured separately (the
batch's verification); this section claims no time gain. Limits: what Object LoD
hides depends on the window's pixels (at 1600×1000 and 1080p Valencia's fitted
overview, 8.3–9 px a hex, hides small objects; a 1440p overview opens at about 12 px
with them shown; a 4K overview hides nothing). A selected small object casts no
shadow while the zoom hides the others. The imported editor still draws more than
the legacy editor: both lose their small objects, and the rest is the difference
between instanced and packed objects.

### Batch 9: one conversion, one capture (2026-10-10)

Every load site converts a legacy board once (`BoardSceneryLayouts.convert`, image-free
common code): the server per sheet before flip and combine (`BoardFile.loadSheet`), old
saves when they load, the map previews (`GpuBoardWindow.loadPreview`) and the editor.
Every 3D view captures through one owner, `BoardTiles`. So the game view and the editor
view of one board differed only by the draw strategy of placed objects: instanced with
per-instance colours in the editor, packed prop pages with CPU recolouring in the game
and the previews (b9-decisions D9, KEEP IN SYNC comments on both sides;
`GpuSceneryColourSmokeTest` held them to 1/255 per pixel but for at most 8 edge pixels
per capture). Batch 13 replaced the two strategies with the editor's (below).

`gpuBoardBenchmark` `GpuLegacyImportSmokeTest.measuresValenciaInTheGameAndTheEditor`
replaces `measuresValenciaLegacyAgainstImported`. It prints Valencia's read, its sheet
load (read and convert) and the editor's open, the Board packet and savegame XML sizes
as read and converted, and for the game view (`GpuBoardSource` through
`GpuBoardFixture`, which also places one Atlas) and the editor view
(`BoardEditorSession.open` and `GpuMapSource`) the settle time, the median and p90 of
60 frames with `glFinish`, and the draws and GL calls per render stage, at the overview
and at the close view of the densest hex. It fails when the editor's opaque draws
exceeded the game view's plus 150 (retired in batch 13, when both views began to draw
placed objects alike). Captures:
`legacy-import-valencia-{game,editor}-{overview,close}.png`. Not run in the step that
wrote it; the batch-9 verification times it.

Measured in batch 9's conversion gate (a headless JVM, no rendering): converting
Valencia took 378–419 ms in a fresh JVM (class loading and the first parse of the
tileset, `layouts.json` and `decals.json`) and 59–95 ms warm, against 653–710 ms cold
and 4.0–7.4 s warm for the old image-based import, whose warm runs waited on animated
GIFs; all 2,422 shipped boards converted in 16.3 s in one JVM. With its legacy tokens
kept in memory, converted Valencia's packet is 4,851,842 bytes (+20.4 % against the
board as read) and its savegame XML 42,674,160 characters (+18.7 %); 48x48 grows by
80.5 % and 66.0 %. These are local runs on one laptop, not general guarantees.

### Batch 13: one object renderer (2026-10-11)

Placed objects (`.board2` objects, converted legacy scenery, the buffer stops a rail
owns) draw the editor's way in every 3D view: game, lobby and map previews, the editor
and the Tactical View. Each model is one shared mesh per mesh
level (`GpuAssets.slotted`, `GpuAssets.objectLevels`); each placement passes its place,
turn, scales, mirror and slot colours as instance data (`GpuTreeInstances`), gathered
per pass from the chunk's object parts (`Chunk.cacheDecorations`, `addDecorations`).
Parts whose pose the instance data cannot hold (tilted, sheared, unevenly stretched) or
whose material has no instanced shader draw one by one. Everything else that was packed
stays packed: buildings' non-modular props, industrial structures, layout scenery rows,
scatter, bridges and routes. The user decided this after a benchmark of the two
strategies (b13-scope item 6; it replaces b9-decisions D9).

What went: the `editableObjects` flag, its setter and `GpuBattleView`'s call; the
`assets.decoration` branch for placed objects and its per-level variant (the CPU colour
copies of placed objects); placed objects in the packed chunk caches and prop pages;
the KEEP IN SYNC pairs that only served the two strategies (`GpuAssets.slotted` /
`decoration`, `Chunk.cacheDecorations` / `cacheProps`, the build switch, the fade-rule
note); and the pixel-parity test between the editor and the game. The remaining pairs
now describe placed objects against packed buildings and scenery (`drawn` and the packed
caches' Tactical View rule, `addDecorations` and the packed caches in each pass) and the GPU recolour
against the CPU copies that layout rows and editor ghosts still use
(`RigidGlb.recolour` / `model-colour-slots.glsl`, compared per vertex by
`RigidGlbTest`). `GpuAssets.decoration` remains for the editor preview's ghosts and the
marked box of a missing file.

**Mirror images.** The benchmark's main risk was mirrored objects: on the all-mirrored
48x48 stress the editor path drew 3,362 loose parts one call each (8,433 draws against
the packed path's 2,043; +36 % frame time on the Iris Xe overview). Now a mirrored
placement is instanced too: the instance's last float marks the mirror, which reverses
the model's y axis before the turn (`tree-instances.glsl`), and mirror images go to a
batch of their own (`GpuTreeInstances.Part` keyed on the mirror) whose mesh draws with
`glFrontFace(GL_CW)` (`GpuInstancedMesh.mirrored`), so every pass culls the faces it
culls for the model unmirrored. Instanced parts therefore keep their model's own culling;
a mirror image drawn one by one or faded keeps both faces or the reversed face as before
(`GpuTerrain.culling`). The tree stand still takes no mirror image (its species batches
keep the counter-clockwise front face); a mirrored plant draws as an object part. The scratch harness on the
all-mirrored 48x48 after the change (Iris Xe, 3840x2359): 1,821 draws in a profiled overview frame, against 1,911
with no object mirrored in the same build (city 1,448 and 1,442, dense 1,287 and 1,277). Frame medians of 31-34 ms
mirrored and 31-33 ms unmirrored at the overview are indicative only: another session's test JVM ran at the time.

**Level changes.** A placed object's mesh level change now gathers only the chunk's
object parts again; buildings still repack the chunk's prop caches
(`GpuTerrain.updateDetail`). The shadow map keeps the previous level until its next
refit, as before. After the level change of a faded (hovered-roof) mirrored tree, consecutive frames took a few frames
to become identical again (2 pixels by 2/255 on its trunk; cause not isolated), so the orchard round trip of
`GpuSceneryColourSmokeTest` compares settled frames.

**Tactical View.** It hides placed plants as it hides every other plant (the game's
former rule, now also the editor's): a placed plant is no structure (`Prop.structure`),
and `GpuTerrain.drawn` applies the Tactical View's rule to drawing and picking alike.

**Picking data.** Every view keeps each placed object's id (not for what a rail owns),
so GM tools can use them; game picking (`selectionHit`, `walkableHit`) is unchanged and
never reports an object, only `decorationHit` does, which only the editor calls.

**Combat scars.** A scar patch on a placed object copies the shared mesh's vertices, so
it carries its placement's colours (the receiving part's `userData`) like a part drawn one
by one; such patches stay out of the merged scar pages, which hold no per-object colours
(`GpuSurfaceScars`). Before batch 13 the game's patches copied the CPU colour copies.

**Small packed caches removed.** With placed objects out of the pages, the packed small
caches could only hold terrain-owned layout rows under a quarter hex, and no shipped row
is that small (rubble, fortification and geyser rows span most of a hex): 36, 102 and 137
small packed parts on the benchmark boards before the switch, 0 after. The user decided to
delete them. Only placed objects are small now (`Prop.small`); a layout row of any size is
packed with the chunk's other props and never hides with the zoom.

Benchmark that led here (`GpuObjectPathBench`, a scratch harness, 2026-10-11, the
user's laptop: Iris Xe and RTX 4070 Laptop 8 GB, 3840x2359, seven boards with 145 to
4,965 objects; the independent check's corrections applied):

| | Packed (game) | Instanced (editor) |
|---|---|---|
| Frame time, NVIDIA, one terrain in memory | 1 | median 1.010 (quartiles 0.971-1.040) |
| Frame time, Iris Xe, clean rounds | 1 | 0.97-1.04 by view (48x48), 0.97-1.02 (Tian-Tan) |
| GPU time | 1 | median 0.992; 2-8 % lower on large overviews |
| CPU time per frame | | +0.2 to +1.3 ms in close views |
| Pixels | | under 0.02 % of a frame differ, all on building seams, as between two builds of one path |
| Object geometry (MiB) | 48x48 48.8, Tian-Tan 312 | 6.6 + 4.3, 33.5 + 42.7 |
| Edit to final frame | | 5-30 % sooner, worst frame about halved |

Two-terrain runs on the 8 GB NVIDIA were video-memory artefacts and are not quoted; no
difference under about 5 % per view is resolvable with 4 rounds a view. Not measured:
units, the HUD, a tilted perspective camera, cutaway fades and LoD-switch sweeps.

Measured after the switch (2026-10-11, scratch harness `AbBench`): the game view before
(b13's base, placed objects packed) and after (instanced), each version's classes in its
own class loader, so both alternate A B B A on one GL context in one process; 3840x2359;
every timed quad, round and edit batch repeated until no other test or benchmark JVM ran
(a first 48x48 run that overlapped one was discarded). Frame median before / after ms,
with the after/before ratio of the four quads (true median):

| Board, GPU | Overview | City | Dense | Pan | GPU time ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 48x48, Iris Xe | 44.0 / 41.9 (0.97) | 41.0 / 40.4 (0.97) | 30.5 / 30.3 (1.00) | 36.5 / 36.4 (1.04) | 0.95-1.01 |
| Tian-Tan, Iris Xe | 228.8 / 227.6 (0.99) | 38.7 / 40.2 (1.02) | 43.1 / 42.9 (1.00) | 42.0 / 42.9 (1.04) | 0.97-1.02 |
| Valencia, Iris Xe, one terrain, 4 rounds | 274.9 / 261.8 (0.97) | 45.5 / 45.5 (0.98) | 62.9 / 62.0 (1.02) | 46.5 / 52.2 (1.01) | 0.95-1.00 |
| 48x48 all mirrored, Iris Xe | 39.4 / 41.4 (1.06) | 35.2 / 35.1 (0.98) | 30.2 / 31.2 (1.05) | 35.8 / 37.1 (1.03) | 0.98-1.03 |
| 48x48, RTX 4070 Laptop | 4.6 / 5.0 (1.08) | 4.6 / 4.8 (1.04) | 4.4 / 4.5 (1.05) | 4.3 / 4.5 (1.05) | 0.89-1.00 |

- CPU per frame: -1.4 to +2.8 ms on the Iris Xe (median +0.7 ms over the 16 views), +0.2
  to +0.5 ms on the NVIDIA (the frames end with `glFinish`, so this is an upper bound).
- All-mirrored 48x48: 1,821 draws in the profiled overview frame against the packed
  path's 2,043 (the editor path drew 8,433 before mirror images were instanced).
- Object geometry (chunk caches, pages, instance buffers, models): 48x48 141.9 to 56.0 MiB,
  Tian-Tan 1,210 to 695 MiB, Valencia 1,493 to 1,183 MiB; no colour copies remain (17, 2
  and 31 before), and no shipped board packs a small prop any more (36, 102 and 137
  small packed parts before, all placed objects).
- A move of a recoloured car (8 samples each, Valencia 16), median time to the final frame
  and worst frame: 48x48 348 / 347 ms and 102 / 65 ms; Tian-Tan 572 / 644 ms (ranges
  505-776 and 554-873) and 98 / 83 ms; Valencia 1,280 / 1,289 ms and 201 / 149 ms; NVIDIA
  48x48 164 / 125 ms and 65 / 22 ms.
- Pixels: a second capture of the before path is identical to the first in every view;
  before against after differs in 0 to 349 pixels of 9.06 million (largest channel
  difference 122/255), all on roof and ground seams where draw order decides; on the
  all-mirrored stress also on thin edges of open mirrored meshes, whose back faces the
  packed path drew (culling none) and the instanced mirror image culls as its model.

Checked by native tests (not timed), all in the game view unless named:

- `GpuMirroredObjectSmokeTest`: a mirrored parking barrier (off its model's centre),
  three mirrored recoloured cars and a mirrored coral draw instanced as mirror images
  (no part one by one), in one draw per model part (the same cars drawn one by one cost
  two more draws per car part), and alike their one-by-one draw with both faces (a tilt
  of 0.05 degrees): barrier 6 of 7,673 object pixels over 32/255, car 30 of 7,749, coral
  766 of 60,245 (its fine self-shadowing); unmirrored, the barrier and the coral differ
  in 15,341 and 45,202 pixels.
- `GpuSceneryColourSmokeTest`: the converted colour fixture loaded the game's way draws
  205 object parts instanced (3 of them mirror images) and 2 one by one, each with its
  object's colours; the magenta mirrored car shows 3,016 magenta and no red pixels and
  the white car 2,957 white ones, as the editor showed them before; levels, the hover
  of the roof's building and its end as before; the Tactical View draws and picks no
  placed plant (3 plant parts in 3D, 0 in the Tactical View, 204 other parts in both),
  while game picking and the hover outline still find the cars' hexes. A combat scar on a
  magenta car draws magenta: of 15,720 changed pixels 3,223 magenta and 16 red (without
  the placement's colours on the patch, or with the patch merged into a scar page: 3,239
  red, 0 magenta).
- `GpuSmallObjectSmokeTest`: the cars hide and return in every pass as before; the upright cars of
  three colours cost one instanced draw and the mirrored car one more; a unit fades the lone car without
  rebuilding a prop page.
- `GpuLegacyImportSmokeTest`: 84 object parts of the converted fixture, 81 instanced and 3 one by one (a
  tilted and a stretched table and the narrow glass roof; the mirrored table instanced); a unit inside the
  roof's building fades its roof objects; 48x48's roof cars stand on the roof.
