/**
 * The one route model of rails and maglev ({@link Kind}): route markers at hex centres. A marker holds the sides it
 * leaves by ({@link BoardDecoration#connections()}, N=1 ... NW=32) and, only where it differs from the default layout of
 * those sides ({@link #pieces(int)}), the track pieces it lays between them ({@link BoardDecoration#tracks()}). Rails as
 * terrain ({@link Terrains#RAIL} on the ground, {@link Terrains#BRIDGE_RAIL} on a bridge deck, exits = sides) yield
 * derived markers, never stored ({@link #markers}); the editor and legacy conversion share {@link #lay}.
 * Each hex has at most one ground rail and one deck rail. A side joins the neighbour's reachable layer of the same
 * kind with the opposite side, so parallel routes in adjacent hexes stay apart and the kinds never join.
 * <p>
 * Every piece is gentle: a straight between opposite sides or a 60-degree arc between sides two apart; no rail vehicle
 * takes the 120-degree turn between adjacent sides, so none is ever laid. A layout is a 9-bit piece mask: bit d (0-2) is
 * the straight from side d to side d + 3, bit 3 + k the arc from side k to side k + 2. A side with no gentle partner (two
 * adjacent sides, or the middle of three) is stranded ({@link #stranded}): it ends in a short stub.
