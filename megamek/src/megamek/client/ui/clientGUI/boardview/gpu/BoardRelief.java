 * pure function of its world position and of the board data around it, so neighbouring tops, their cliffs, picking
 * and unit support agree exactly without exchanging meshes. Game data stays authoritative: a rim sits at its hex's
 * level, a cliff foot at the lower neighbour's level, and the unit anchor in each hex stays level.
 *
 * <p>Corners are identified on the integer corner lattice ({@link #cornerX}), so all three hexes around a corner
 * evaluate the same {@link Corner}. A cliff between two hexes is owned by the higher one; its foot row is also the
 * lower hex's boundary. Walls use rows at fixed absolute heights, so cliffs of different spans meeting on a corner
 * line share every vertex. Visual displacement is horizontal and bounded; it never changes a game elevation.</p>
